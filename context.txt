## **Entities and Attributes**  

### 1. **Student**  
   - **Attributes**:  
     - `s_id` (Primary Key)  
     - `name` (composite: `first_name`, `middle_name`, `last_name`)  
     - `date_of_birth`, `address`, `national_id`, `phone_number`  

### 2. **Course**

---

## **Relationships**  

### 1. **Takes** (Student ↔ Course)  
   - **Attributes**: `semester`, `year`, `GPA`  
   - **Cardinality**:  
     - **Many-to-Many**: A student can enroll in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students.  
   - **Participation**:  
     - **Total** for both entities: Every student must enroll in at least one course, and every course must have at least one student.  

### 2. **Teaches** (Instructor ↔ Course)  
   - **Cardinality**:  
     - **Many-to-Many**: An instructor can teach multiple courses, and a course can be taught by multiple instructors.  
   - **Participation**:  
     - **Partial** for instructor, **Total** for Course: An instructor might not teach any courses (e.g., administrative role), but a course has to be assigned to an instructor.  

### 3. **Offers** (Department → Course)  
   - **Cardinality**:  
     - **One-to-Many**: A department offers many courses, but each course is offered by exactly one department.  
   - **Implementation**: Embedded via `dept_name` foreign key in **Course** (no dedicated table).  

### 4. **Works** (Instructor → Department)  
   - **Cardinality**:  
     - **Many-to-One**: Many instructors work in one department, but an instructor belongs to only one department.  
   - **Implementation**: Embedded via `dept_name` foreign key in **Instructor** (no dedicated table).  

### 5. **Prereq** (Course → Course)  
   - **Cardinality**:  
     - **Recursive Many-to-Many**: A course can have multiple prerequisites, and a course can be a prerequisite for multiple courses.  
   - **Example**: Course "Database Systems" may require "Intro to SQL" and "Data Structures."  

### 6. **Has** (Student → Profile)  
   - **Cardinality**:  
     - **One-to-One**: Each student has exactly one profile, and each profile belongs to one student.  
   - **Participation**:  
     - **Total** for Student: Every student must have a profile.  

### 7. **Maintains** (Student → AcademicStatus)  
   - **Cardinality**:  
     - **One-to-One**: Each student has one academic status record.  
   - **Participation**:  
     - **Total** for Student: Every student must have an academic status.  

### 8. **Belongs to** (AcademicStatus → Department)  
   - **Cardinality**:  
     - **Many-to-One**: An academic status is tied to one department, but a department can have many academic status records (e.g., for multiple students).  
   - **Implementation**: Embedded via `dept_name` foreign key in **AcademicStatus**.

## **Keys**  

### **Primary Keys**  
- **Student**: `s_id`  
- **Course**: `course_code`  
- **Department**: `dept_name`  
- **Instructor**: `i_id`  
- **Profile**: `email`  
- **AcademicStatus**: `status_id`  
- **Records**: `record_id`  

### **Foreign Keys**  
- **Takes**: `s_id` (Student), `course_code` (Course).  
- **Teaches**: `i_id` (Instructor), `course_code` (Course).  
- **Course**: `dept_name` (Department).  
- **Instructor**: `dept_name` (Department).  
- **AcademicStatus**: `s_id` (Student), `dept_name` (Department).  
- **Profile**: `s_id` (Student).  
- **Records**: `s_id` (Student).

## **Additional Notes**  

1. **Composite Attributes**:  
   - `name` in **Student** and **Instructor** is decomposed into `first_name`, `middle_name`, and `last_name`.  

2. **Derived Attributes**:  
   - `GPA` in **AcademicStatus** and **Takes** may be calculated from course grades.  

3. **Recursive Relationships**:  
   - **Prereq** allows courses to reference other courses as prerequisites (e.g., "Advanced Algorithms" requires "Intro to Algorithms").  

4. **Simplified Relationships**:  
   - **Offers** and **Works** do not require dedicated tables; relationships are embedded via foreign keys.  

5. **No Weak Entities**: All entities have independent primary keys.

Respond ONLY with the SQL query, without any explanation, markdown formatting like ```sql``` or any additional text. Output the SQL statement exclusively. e.g.: 
EXAMPLE 1:
User: "What's the prerequisite for course `Physics 1`?"
Assistant: "SELECT name FROM courses JOIN prerequisites ON courses.course_code = prerequisites.course_code WHERE course_name = 'Physics 1';"

EXAMPLE 2:
User: "Show my current courses."
Assistant: "SELECT c.title FROM teaches t JOIN Course ON t.course_code = c.course_code WHERE t.s_id = @user_id;"
